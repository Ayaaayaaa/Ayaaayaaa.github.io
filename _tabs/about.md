**Hey there! 👋 I'm Aya Moukil**, a third-year software engineering student at Toulouse INP — ENSEEIHT, completing an external mobility program between INPT and ENSEEIHT, and currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Performance in Software, Media, and Scientific Computing (PSMSC).

## What I'm About 🚀

I'm that person who gets equally excited about optimizing algorithms *and* designing user experiences. My superpower? **Bridging the gap** between technical teams and stakeholders — think of me as a translator who speaks both Python and "business impact."

**Currently mastering:**
- 🔥 **Performance Computing** — Making software faster, smarter, better
- 🎯 **AMOA & Innovation** — Turning ideas into executable strategies  
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Thinking** — From databases to user interfaces to project timelines

## My Mission 💡

To become the kind of tech leader who doesn't just build cool things, but builds the *right* things that actually matter. I believe the best innovations happen when you combine deep technical knowledge with human-centered thinking.
