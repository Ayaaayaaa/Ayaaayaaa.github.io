Hiii!! I'm Aya Moukil, a second-year engineering student specializing in innovation and AMOA (Assistance à Maîtrise d’Ouvrage). My enthusiasm for this path stems from my desire to engage with all areas of computer science, combining analysis, strategy, and project management. My goal is to apply my knowledge in diverse contexts and to evolve towards roles of responsibility while actively contributing to technological advancement.
