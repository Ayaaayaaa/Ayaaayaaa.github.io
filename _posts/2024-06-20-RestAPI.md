# Overview:
This project is a REST API for a task management application, built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides endpoints for user authentication, creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as retrieving user profile information.

# Technologies Used:
* Docker
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB 
* Mongoose 
* JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* bcrypt for password hashing
* Nodemon
* Postman

# Key Features :

###    User Registration and Authentication:
* Allows users to register with their name, email, and password.
* Ensures email uniqueness and securely stores passwords using bcrypt.
* Generates and returns a JWT token upon successful login, which can be used to access protected routes.
###    Task Management:
* Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete their tasks.
* Tasks are associated with the user who created them, ensuring data ownership.
* Provides endpoints to list all tasks, consult the profile , update a specific task, and delete a task.

###    Error Handling:
* Implements robust error handling, providing meaningful error messages to the client.
* Handles common errors such as invalid inputs, duplicates, and resource not found.
###    Docker Integration:
* Utilizes Docker to run the MongoDB Express server, ensuring a consistent , scalable  and reproducible development environment.


# Technical Approach:
#### Dependencies: 
```json 
    "bcrypt": "^5.1.1",
    "body-parser": "^1.20.2",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.5",
    "express": "^4.19.2",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.4.3",
    "nodemon": "^3.1.4"
```
#### Project Structure: 
The project follows a modular and extensible structure, which makes it easy to understand and maintain. The key components of the project structure are:

##### Models:
 The Mongoose models define the schema for users and tasks databases and provide the interface for interacting with the MongoDB database.
##### Middleware.js:(authentification)
Contains an asynchronous middleware function "authenticate" that checks if the incoming request has a valid JWT token and attaches the corresponding user information to the request object before allowing them to access the protected routes.
##### routing.js: 
The main routing file for the REST API application that handles user authentication and authorization, defines the following routes and endpoints:

* User Registration:
Endpoint: /register
HTTP Method: POST
Description: Handles the registration of a new user. It takes in the name, email, and password in the request body and creates a new user in the database.

* User Login:
Endpoint: /login
HTTP Method: POST
Description: Handles the login process for an existing user. It takes the email and password in the request body, verifies the credentials, and generates a JWT token if the login is successful.

* Retrieve User Tasks:
Endpoint: /tasks
HTTP Method: GET
Description: Retrieves the list of tasks associated with the authenticated user. It uses the authenticate middleware to ensure that only authenticated users can access this endpoint.

* Retrieve User Profile:
Endpoint: /profile
HTTP Method: GET
Description: Retrieves the profile information for the authenticated user. It uses the authenticate middleware to ensure that only authenticated users can access this endpoint.

* Create a Task:
Endpoint: /tasks
HTTP Method: POST
Description: Allows the authenticated user to create a new task. It takes in the request body and associates the task with the user.

* Update a Task:
Endpoint: /tasks/:id
HTTP Method: PUT
Description: Allows the authenticated user to update an existing task. It takes the task id as a parameter and the updated task data in the request body.

* Delete a Task:
Endpoint: /tasks/:id
HTTP Method: DELETE
Description: Allows the authenticated user to delete an existing task. It takes the task id as a parameter and removes the task from the database.

##### app.js :
 This file sets up the core functionality of the application and the necessary infrastructure, including : Loading Environment Variables,Creation of an instance of the Express.js Application, Configuring Middleware, Establishing Database Connection,Mounting Routing Middleware, Starting the Express.js server and listening for incoming connections on a specified port.
