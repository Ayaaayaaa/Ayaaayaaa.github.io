```

##### Object Detection API (analyze.js):
The core API endpoint handles the complete object detection pipeline:

* **Image Processing**:
  - Endpoint: /api/analyze
  - HTTP Method: POST
  - Description: Processes uploaded images through multiple AI models for comprehensive object detection and analysis.

* **Multi-Model Detection Pipeline**:
  - Primary Model: facebook/detr-resnet-50 for general object detection
  - Fallback Model: microsoft/table-transformer-detection for specialized detection
  - Emergency Model: Ultralytics/YOLOv8n for fast processing
  - Custom Fallback: Intelligent simulation based on typical detection patterns

* **Response Processing**:
  - Confidence threshold filtering to ensure detection accuracy
  - Object categorization into predefined categories
  - Metadata collection including processing time and model performance
  - Density analysis and feedback generation

##### Frontend Components:
The React-based frontend provides an intuitive and responsive user interface:

* **Landing Page** (app/page.js): Marketing-focused homepage with feature highlights and call-to-action elements directing users to the upload interface.

* **Upload Interface** (app/upload/page.js): Advanced file upload component featuring drag-and-drop functionality, file preview, validation, and progress tracking during image processing.

* **Results Dashboard** (app/results/page.js): Comprehensive analytics display showing detected objects, category breakdowns, visual indicators, and detailed image metadata.

* **Dark Mode System**: Context-based theme management with automatic system preference detection and manual toggle capability.

##### AI Model Integration:
The application implements a sophisticated AI model integration strategy:

```javascript
// Multi-model detection approach
const models = [
  'facebook/detr-resnet-50',
  'microsoft/table-transformer-detection', 
  'Ultralytics/YOLOv8n'
];

// Progressive fallback with confidence filtering
const detectObjects = async (imageData) => {
  for (const model of models) {
    try {
      const response = await queryHuggingFace(model, imageData);
      return filterByConfidence(response, 0.3);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(`Model ${model} failed, trying next...`);
    }
  }
  return intelligentFallback(imageData);
};
```

##### Object Categorization System:
Detected objects are intelligently categorized into meaningful groups:

* **Personnes** (People): Human detection and counting
* **Animaux** (Animals): Wildlife and pet identification
* **Véhicules** (Vehicles): Cars, trucks, motorcycles, and transportation
* **Mobilier** (Furniture): Household and office furniture items
* **Électronique** (Electronics): Computers, phones, and electronic devices
* **Sports**: Sports equipment and recreational items
* **Nourriture** (Food): Food items and culinary objects
* **Vêtements** (Clothing): Apparel and fashion accessories
* **Objets divers** (Miscellaneous): Uncategorized or general objects

##### Error Handling and Reliability:
Comprehensive error management ensures robust application performance:

* **Timeout Management**: 15-second request timeouts prevent hanging states
* **Progressive Fallback**: Multiple model attempts with intelligent degradation
* **Input Validation**: Client-side and server-side image format and size validation
* **Graceful Recovery**: User-friendly error messages with retry capabilities
* **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed logging and processing time tracking

##### Session Management:
Privacy-focused data handling with temporary storage:

* **Session Storage**: Results stored temporarily in browser sessionStorage
* **No Permanent Retention**: Data cleared after analysis completion
* **Privacy-First Approach**: No server-side data persistence or user tracking
* **Secure Processing**: Image data processed in-memory without permanent storage

# Performance Metrics:
