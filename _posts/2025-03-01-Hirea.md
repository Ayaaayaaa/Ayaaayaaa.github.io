##### Mobile Application Architecture:
The React Native application provides an intuitive user experience with the following flow:

* **Authentication System**: Firebase-powered user registration and login with email/password authentication, automatic session management, and secure token handling.

* **CV Upload Interface**: 
  - Endpoint: Image selection via expo-image-picker
  - Process: Real-time image preview, validation, and compression before upload
  - Integration: Direct API call to FastAPI backend for processing

* **Job Matching Display**:
  - Real-time processing indicators with animated loading states
  - Structured results showing job titles, companies, locations, and compatibility scores
  - Interactive job cards with detailed information and application links

##### Backend API Architecture:
FastAPI serves as the core processing engine with the following endpoints:

* **CV Processing**:
  - Endpoint: /extract-skills
  - HTTP Method: POST
  - Description: Processes uploaded CV images through OCR, extracts text content, and identifies technical and soft skills using NLP algorithms.

* **Job Matching**:
  - Endpoint: /match-skills  
  - HTTP Method: POST
  - Description: Compares extracted CV skills against job requirements stored in MongoDB, calculates compatibility scores, and returns ranked job recommendations.

* **Data Retrieval**:
  - Endpoint: /jobs
  - HTTP Method: GET
  - Description: Retrieves filtered job listings based on user preferences, location, and skill compatibility scores.

##### ELT Pipeline Architecture:
The data pipeline operates on a scheduled basis with the following components:

* **Extract Phase** (job_spider.py):
  - Multi-platform web scraping using specialized Scrapy spiders
  - Rotating user agents and proxy support for reliable data extraction
  - Structured data extraction including job titles, descriptions, requirements, locations, and salary information
  - Error handling and retry logic for failed requests

* **Load Phase** (job_loader.py):
  - Direct insertion of raw scraped data into MongoDB Atlas collections
  - Data deduplication using job URL and title hashing
  - Timestamp tracking for data freshness and update scheduling
  - Batch processing optimization for high-volume data ingestion

* **Transform Phase** (nlp_processing.py):
  - Text cleaning and normalization of job descriptions
  - Skill extraction using custom NLP models and predefined vocabularies  
  - TF-IDF vectorization for semantic analysis and similarity calculations
  - Categorization of jobs by industry, experience level, and skill requirements

##### Matching Algorithm Implementation:
The core matching system uses advanced NLP techniques:

```python
# Skill Matching Algorithm
def calculate_match_score(resume_skills, job_skills):
    common_skills = set(resume_skills) & set(job_skills)
    match_score = len(common_skills) / len(job_skills) if job_skills else 0
    
    # Weight by skill importance and experience level
    weighted_score = sum(skill_weights.get(skill, 1.0) for skill in common_skills)
    final_score = (match_score * 0.7) + (weighted_score / len(job_skills) * 0.3)
    
    return min(final_score, 1.0)
```

##### Database Schema Design (MongoDB):
The NoSQL document structure optimizes for flexible querying and scalability:

* **Users Collection**: Stores user profiles, authentication data, uploaded CV metadata, and matching preferences
* **Jobs Collection**: Contains scraped job data with processed skill requirements, location information, and application details
* **Skills Collection**: Maintains skill taxonomy, importance weights, and category mappings
* **Matches Collection**: Caches calculated compatibility scores and user-specific job recommendations

##### OCR and NLP Processing:
Advanced text processing pipeline for CV analysis:

* **OCR Processing**: EasyOCR with multi-language support (French/English), confidence threshold filtering, and text region detection
* **Skill Extraction**: spaCy pipeline with custom entity recognition models, regex patterns for technical skills, and contextual analysis
* **Text Normalization**: Standardization of job titles, skill names, and experience descriptors across different platforms

# Performance and Scalability:

### System Performance Metrics:
* CV processing time: Average 3-5 seconds for OCR and skill extraction
* Job matching algorithm: Sub-second response times for up to 10,000 job comparisons
* Pipeline throughput: Processes 1,000+ job listings per hour with full NLP analysis
* Mobile app responsiveness: <2 second load times for job results display

### Cloud Infrastructure Benefits:
* MongoDB Atlas auto-scaling handles traffic spikes and data growth
* Airflow on Astronomer provides managed orchestration with monitoring and alerting
* Docker containerization ensures consistent performance across environments
* Firebase Authentication scales automatically with user base growth

# Data Processing Workflow:

### Daily Pipeline Execution:
1. **Scheduled Scraping** (2:00 AM daily): Airflow triggers multi-platform job extraction
2. **Data Validation**: Automated quality checks and duplicate removal
3. **NLP Processing**: Skill extraction and job categorization using trained models
4. **Database Updates**: Incremental loading with change detection and versioning
5. **Cache Refresh**: Pre-computed matching scores for improved API response times

### User Interaction Flow:
1. User uploads CV image through mobile interface
2. FastAPI processes image with OCR and extracts text content
3. NLP pipeline identifies skills, experience level, and career objectives
4. Matching algorithm compares against processed job database
5. Results ranked by compatibility score and user preferences
6. Mobile app displays personalized job recommendations with application links

# Future Enhancements:
* Advanced recommendation engine using collaborative filtering and machine learning models
* Real-time notifications for new matching opportunities using push notification services
* PDF CV processing support expanding beyond image-based uploads  
* Multi-language NLP support for Arabic job descriptions and CVs
* Integration with additional job platforms and company career pages
* Video interview scheduling and integration with popular conferencing tools
* Salary prediction models based on skills, experience, and market trends
* Professional networking features connecting users with similar career paths
